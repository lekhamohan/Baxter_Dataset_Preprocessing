So, this documentation kinda walks you through what each scripts do. 
MAke sure you always eun these scripts on a small subset of data before running it on the original dataset, cause collecting data is difficult y'all!!!

In case of questions, message me in WhatsApp or Facebook or GoogleHangouts. 
Take care of Baxter, he needs some rest.

**************************NOTE*************************************

After collecting baxter demonstrations, run 
python sort_HD_RD_Demo.py
python jointAngles_remove_unwanted.py
python jointAngles.py
#TO LABEL
python can_you_label_me_no_see.py

**************************END OF NOTE***********************

can_you_label_me_no_see.py:
		This script labels all the trajectories that you have collected. The labels are in label.pdf. The only input you have to give is the label number(Ex-1 if your trajectories are "pouring") and the start and end number of trajectories(Ex: 13100Dec01 - 13250Dec22).


check_I_am_dumper.py:
		Dumps images,labels and joint angles files into a .hdf5 file for network training. Be mindful of the directory path

copy_files.py:
		Copies files recursively from source to dest 


count_label.py:
		Counts labels and it's frequency in your dataset. USeful if you want to know number of trajectories in respective classes. 

create_subset.py:
	   Creates subset of your data set for 60 timesteps. PLEASE follow the comments carefully or rwrite this code or contact me at 412-961-5726

image_disp.py:
	Just displays croppedimages, nothing interesting!

jointAngles.py:
         Converts the Baxter jointAngles into dictionary data type and stores them. Pretty useful format if you ask me. 

jointAngles_remove_unwanted.py:
	 Lol!! When Baxter got updated, we had newinformation on jointAngles which we decided was not necesaary. So, had to write this script that would weed out unnecesary files.

plot_trajecotries.py:
	 The name says it all! Still read through the code

sort_me_if_you_can_VERSION2.py:
	Whenever you collect data, it is stores human demonstrations and corresponding robot demonstrations separately. This script puts them all into one folder named as 
for example :12350Dec24
		|___HD 12350Dec24
			|__<sub_directories>
		|
		|__RD 12350Dec24
			|_<sub_directories>
